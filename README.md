# zdpack

zdpack stands for "Zach's Datapacker" and was a tool for merging and converting Minecraft data and resource packs.

This project is now discontinued. If you want global data or resource packs in a modpack of your own, here are two solutions:
- If your packs are small enough (<5MB) or you are using Firefox and can [increase the size of localStorage](https://www.mathgeniuszach.com/response/local-storage/), you can use the [Origin Creator](https://www.mathgeniuszach.com/apps/origin-creator/)'s export to mod feature instead. This is up-to-date to the latest version of Minecraft.
- Check out the mods [Global Packs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/drp-global-datapack) and [Paxi](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/paxi). I recommend Global Packs over Paxi, but if you want more configuration use Paxi.

I've decided to discontinue this project for a few reasons:
- I really hate working with electron, which was what I was using for the UI in this project.
- Virus scanners kept breaking and false-flagging the tool by falsly flagging the jar files on peoples' machines (sometimes even silently deleting the file with no message at all).
- There are other, simpler solutions through existing mods.

This was a hard decision as this was one of my most starred repositories, but I personally feel it's best to just discontinue it at this point. I won't ever delete the repository but I'm going to stop working on it from now on.
